(** {e O(n log n)} Computes sample's ranks, [ties_strategy] controls
    which ranks are assigned to equal values:

    - [`Average] the average of ranks should be assigned to each value.
      {b Default}.
    - [`Min] the minimum of ranks is assigned to each value.
    - [`Max] the maximum of ranks is assigned to each value.

    Returns a pair, where the first element is ties correction factor
    and second is an array of sample ranks.

(** Calculates summary statistics over a possibly infinite stream of data.

    The algorithm runs in {e O(1)} space and {e O(n)} time.

    It is preferred for computing standard deviation, because roundoff
    errors in floating point operations might lead to taking a square
    root of a negative value.
